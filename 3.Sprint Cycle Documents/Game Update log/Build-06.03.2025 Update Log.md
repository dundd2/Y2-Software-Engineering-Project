# Property Tycoon - Build-06.03.2025 Update Log  

## Changes

**src/Game.py**  

- Added voluntary exit functionality and improved player handling. The backend was already implemented in a previous version, but there was no UI for it.  

**src/Player.py**  

- Enhanced player exit visuals and logic.  

### **Bug Fixes:**  

- Fixed the issue where the end-game page was not working and only displayed a dark screen.  
- The issue was caused by incorrect calls from `main.py`, which has now been corrected.
