# Property Tycoon - Build-11.03.2025 Update Log

## Changes

- Added a force update mechanism to ensure the game progresses even without user input.

- Added regular display updates to keep the UI responsive.

- Redid jail UI and added periodic redraw timers to ensure the UI updates regularly even without mouse movement. (bug before)

- Added a forced redraw timer to ensure the UI updates regularly.To make sure time limit mode can end the game with out a ui bug blocking.

- Created and added the new pause button. The game will pause until the player clicks the "Continue" button.(Based on Eric's idea from last Thursday's group meeting)

- Added a new hard option for AI player. I guess you will love it (I didn't spend a lot of time because it is based on the easy AI).

- Made sure POT_LUCK and OPPORTUNITY_KNOCKS can work because I haven't made some of them work as they should yet, including the "pay 10 pounds for each player" card. I am not sure if all the cards are now working as they should.
