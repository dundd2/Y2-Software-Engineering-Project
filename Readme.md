This repository contains **Property Tycoon**, a game developed using **Pygame** for Year 2 **G6046: Software Engineering** Assignments between January and April 2025.The game is coded in **Python** but compiled to native machine code using **Nuitka** for enhanced performance. The original game is built on the Pygame library, which is a set of Python modules designed for writing video games.

## Grade
Grade: 78/100 (Overall a solid effort with good team collaboration and Agile process adoption. The Sphinx-themed online documentation was a highlight, providing valuable high and low-level details. The AI player implementation is a good foundation for future development. Areas for improvement include more comprehensive code-level documentation and unit testing. The video presentation was noted as a bit overwhelming with the music.)
